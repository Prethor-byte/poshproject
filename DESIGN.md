### UI/UX Refactor & Consistency Guidelines
- All automation-related screens now use custom UI components (`Card`, `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Alert`, `Label`, `Dialog`, etc.) for a unified look and feel.
- Forms are accessible, robust, and follow the project’s design system.
- Modals and tables use semantic HTML and custom styles for clarity and accessibility.
- All major lint and TypeScript errors have been resolved for maintainability.
- Alerts and user feedback are handled with custom `Alert` components.
- **Guidelines:** Always use the custom UI library for new features, ensure accessibility, and keep the UI consistent and robust.
